  description: 'Our site is focused on supporting rice farmers in Sri Lanka by providing smart, data-driven tools to improve paddy yield, manage diseases, and control weeds. By working closely with agricultural experts and conducting field research, we identified key challenges farmers face and developed a system that offers practical solutions based on real environmental and farming data. This platform helps farmers choose the right crop varieties, detect diseases early, and manage weeds effectively, ultimately aiming to increase productivity, reduce losses, and promote sustainable farming practices across the country.',
