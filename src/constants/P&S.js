    content: 'Current air quality monitoring systems lack the ability to effectively reduce emissions in real-time. While these systems monitor pollution, they often do not optimize industrial processes or provide immediate alerts based on real-time data. Additionally, many systems fail to offer predictive models for anticipating pollution spikes, leading to delays in taking preventive measures.',
