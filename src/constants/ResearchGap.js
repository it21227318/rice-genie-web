  introText: 'Our site aims to bridge the gap between agricultural research and real-world paddy farming in Sri Lanka by providing accessible, data-driven tools for farmers. While most existing systems focus mainly on weather data, our approach integrates real-time environmental factors and local challenges, like soil, pests, and socio-economic conditions, to offer more accurate yield predictions and crop recommendations. Tools like VarietyGenie help translate complex data into practical insights, empowering farmers with localized guidance for variety selection, disease treatment, and weed management. This helps promote sustainable and climate-resilient farming practices.',
