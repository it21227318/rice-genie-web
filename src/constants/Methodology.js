    content: 'This study develops the RICE Genie platform, integrating four key components: paddy yield prediction, rice variety recommendation, pre-harvest disease detection with treatment advice, and weed classification with management strategies. Using machine learning and deep learning, the system leverages diverse datasets, including field images of diseases and weeds, as well as tabular data on soil types, weather patterns, and historical yields collected from research institutes and farms across Sri Lanka. Data preprocessing techniques such as image augmentation and tabular data cleaning ensure robust model training. The methodology combines advanced AI techniques with domain expertise to provide accurate, timely, and localized decision support, aiming to empower smallholder farmers with practical tools for sustainable and efficient paddy cultivation.',
